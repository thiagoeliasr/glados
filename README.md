# GlaDOS BOT

This is my Telegram bot to perform some simple tasks I need often.
Besides the name, it doesn't have anything related to the Valve/Portal game.
(Just chose this name because I like the game a lot ðŸ˜€)

Using the [Python Telegram Bot Lib](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)
to accomplish what I need.

This project was made for fun. I'm having a lot of spare time in pandemic,
so I decided to code, learn and have fun.

## How to use it

In first place, it is necessary to create the bot in Telegram and get the token for the bot.
I recommend the official documentation for this [How do I create a bot](
https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

With the token in hands, clone the project and then define the BOT_TOKEN in your terminal
environment.

In UNIX systems it can be done with:

```sh
export BOT_TOKEN=<your_token>
```

You can define it in your `.profile` or `.bashrc`, so you don't need to export it everytime.

With your token defined, just execute it with python3 and it'll be up and running.
